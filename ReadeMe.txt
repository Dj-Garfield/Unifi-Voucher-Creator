To suit Version 4.x.x of Unifi Controller, will NOT work on 3.x.x i dont think, not tried. you can try it and let us know if you like.

you need a thermal printer, one that accepts POS/ESC commands, you can pick one of these up brand new from ebay for around AU$40-50
just enter the words "USB 58mm POS Printer Thermal" and it lists them all.
or search google for model number that i am using "ZJ-5890T". This is the model printer that i know works.
other printers will work as well but they muct accept the POS/ESC commands and youll need to do a bit of recoding of this script.

Install the printer, set it up as per the instructions on the supplied CD, name it something, what ever you name it
you must enter this name in the unificreatevoucher.php script under the printer variable.

All you have to do is download with current directory structure change then change some variables in unificreatevoucher.php, 
then run it and thats about it. Should work.

it may throw up some PHP errors, i cant remember the ones, just google them as there are extensions in the php.ini file
you need to uncomment that are required to make it work.

But all up its not too hard.
